			you are the brain & i am the heart <br>
so i alphabetized your synonyms & my secrets, <br>
folded myself into warm quarters in your suit pocket, <br>
bit my tongue & trembled at the sight of your name,<br>
to understand our solvency train through the augur of your lens,<br>
to make & break the silence of yesterday & tomorrow: <br><br>

hold that thought, let me speak, i ache to – <br>
again, i say instead, again & again & again, one last time, <br>
speak to me, hold me close, look me in the eye, leave me waiting; <br>
you will leave & i will recede, tide to moon to snow too soon, but <br>
my red eyes & buried letters only run away from your time, <br>
i write & write & write because we are running out of time.<br><br>

A is for agape: every confidence i thieve<br>
from your core, clutching them like unripe persimmons, <br>
or microcephalic infants swathed in blue, every <br>
stripped explanation of a matter of the heart, the infinity <br>
of your contradictions & my untruths, holy in generous theory: <br>
why you forgive & forget all too soon. <br><br>
B is for beloved: tell me what to do <br>
when “forever” means “biennial” & “end” means “gone” <br>
& you do not understand; a placeholder cannot <br>
take me apart & reconstruct me from razor shards, lightning rejects; <br>
i chose you & will choose you – i give & i take & you do not need to <br>
pretend you do not see: please, stay, forget me, stay. <br><br>
			C is for constant: i told you, i have learned <br>
to look for you in every room, to listen for your voice <br>
in every crowd; but you, you will never remember the words <br>
i hide behind sharp teeth, i have dissected my veins & found <br>
your sound, each time you saved me from splinters & eclipses, <br>
saved me from conceptualizing myself & my heat. <br><br>

D is for doubt: expectations are your bane, my death, <br>
i promised i hold you to nothing but nothing means nothing <br>
until i quell the louder voice slipping up the cracks of my spine<br>
threatening maybe & hope & someone will stay;<br>
tell me, how do i solve for you, for the time i have, <br>
when absence is the king of sorrow? <br><br>

dictionaries of inked notes, of pleads & tears & blood<br>
stiched into my pillow: one night, two nights, a year without<br>
you, my life without you – a drama, a library could not hold <br>
the platitudes of yearning, the press of my phone to my cheek,<br>
hyperventilation & resting tremors, the strings of apropper puppet heart that it danced its last when you bid goodbye to us.<br>
