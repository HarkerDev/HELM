			<span class="content-title">Ode to a Starling</span> <span class="content-author"> by Kathy Fang ('20)</span><br>
			Blithe starling! wings of gold and blue,<br>
In skies of gray thou flyest far<br>
Thy gilded melody of truth<br>
Could naught by soot be ever marr’d:<br>
Thy plumage, black as deepest night,<br>
Could never shine with more the gleam:<br>
Thy soften’d flight so humble graced<br>
Thy eyes are spheres of wondrous light,<br>
Thy talons sharp and small they seem,<br>
As if the Fates had Eden cased—<br><br>

And when surround’d by ravens black<br>
Thou proves thyself of humble spirit:<br>
For vain may be what thou doth lack<br>
And thou hast none the need for it—<br>
Yet when surround’d by larks so gold,<br>
Thou radiates unlike the crowd:<br>
Thou think thyself a starling mere—<br>
As if thou never withers old;<br>
And though thou never sings as loud,<br>
The world doth hold her breath to hear—<br><br>

Thy song, which in its tune so quaint<br>
From Heaven’s crypt of dusty scripts,<br>
And though thou thinkst thy song so faint<br>
Thy message, lightly veiled in mist,<br>
Doth travel far beyond the skies:<br>
“Perhaps the beauty in a song,<br>
The golden glimmer in a tune<br>
Ought come from someplace deep inside:<br>
Perhaps the heart who loves so long,<br>
Or from the soul, which freed so soon,<br><br>

“Should joyous be when tied in chains<br>
Of poems sung in rhythm’d song<br>
Of structure, rhyme, perhaps, refrain:<br>
For when constraint is fixed upon<br>
The wings of Poet’s artful bird,<br>
Unconscious frees her beak and sings<br>
Of lands unfound and seas unknown,<br>
Of jade and diamond shining firm,<br>
And gifts thou with a set of wings<br>
And hence thou hast a Poet’s poem.”<br><br>
